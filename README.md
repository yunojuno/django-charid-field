# django-cuidfield

Provides a CuidField for your Django models.

A [cuid](https://github.com/ericelliott/cuid) is a collision-resistant ID optimised for horizontal
scaling and performance; it was designed by [@ericelliot](https://github.com/ericelliott).

A cuid looks like this:

`cjld2cjxh0000qzrmn831i7rn`

and has the following properties:

-   fast, tiny implementation.
-   collision-free generation client or server side (horizontally scaleable).
-   can be created before insertion, avoiding db-round trips to get an id.
-   monotonically increasing, for better primary key peformance.
-   URL-safe. No need to guess whether it should be hyphenated.
-   more portable than GUID/UUID.
-   and [plenty more](https://github.com/ericelliott/cuid).

This library supports:

-   prefixing the ID on a per-model basis à la Stripe. e.g `cus_` => `cus_cjld2cjxh0000qzrmn831i7rn`
-   PostgreSQL only. It will likely work with other database backends, but we will only maintain for
    PostgreSQL.
-   Python 3.9 & above only.

## 👩‍💻 Development

### 🏗️ Local environment

The local environment is handled with `poetry`, so install that first then:

```
$ poetry install
```

### 🧪 Running tests

The tests themselves use `pytest` as the test runner.

After setting up the environment, run them using:

```
$ poetry run pytest
```

The full CI suite is controlled by `tox`, which contains a set of environments that will format
(`fmt`), lint, and test against all support Python + Django version combinations.

```
$ tox
```

#### ⚙️ CI

Uses GitHub Actions, see `./github/workflows`.
